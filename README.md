# LatticeVision

A private repository for my third paper, which uses a TransUNet architecture that takes in non-stationary fields and outputs their parameter (awght) fields for fast simulation with LatticeKrig. 

gitignore specifies that data folder is ignored, data needs to be transferred manually from my machine to Daniel's

Daniel's machine has a remote env set up using UV

run `make help` to see available commands
